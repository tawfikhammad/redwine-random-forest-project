# red-wine--random-forest-prodect
this is classification task that predicts quality of red wine if it's good or not.

## project details:

this is classification task that predicts quality of red wine if it's good or not.


## Dataset content :


* This datasets is related to red variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. For more details, consult the reference [Cortez et al., 2009]. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).

### columns:

1 fixed acidity :
* most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile.

2 volatile acidity :

* the amount of acetic acid in wine .

3 citric acid : 

* found in small quantities, citric acid can add freshness and flavor to wines.

4 residual sugar: 

* the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops.

5 chlorides : 
* the amount of salt in the wine.

6 free sulfur dioxide :
* the free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion.
* it prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine.

7 total sulfur dioxide :

* amount of free and bound forms of S02.
* at free SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine.

8 density : 
* the density of water that depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content.

9 pH :
* describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 to 14 .
* most wines are between 3-4 on the pH scale.

10 sulphates : 
* a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels.
* which acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant

11 alcohol : 
* the percent alcohol content of the wine

12 quality : 
* this target column.
* output variable (based on sensory data, score between 3 and 8)


## build with :

* Python
* Pandas
* sklearn
