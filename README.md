# Red wine random forest project
This is classification task that predicts quality of red wine if it's good or not.

## Dataset content :

This datasets is related to red variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. For more details, consult the reference [Cortez et al., 2009]. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).

### columns:

1- **`fixed acidity`** :  Most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile.

2- **`volatile acidity`** : The amount of acetic acid in wine .

3- **`citric acid`** : Found in small quantities, citric acid can add freshness and flavor to wines.

4- **`residual sugar`**: The amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops.

5- **`chlorides`** : The amount of salt in the wine.

6- **`free sulfur dioxide`** : The free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion. It prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine.

7- **`total sulfur dioxide`** : Amount of free and bound forms of S02. At free SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine.

8- **`density`** : The density of water that depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content.

9- **`pH`** : Describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 to 14. Most wines are between 3-4 on the pH scale.

10- **`sulphates`** : A wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels. Which acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant.

11- **`alcohol`** : The percent alcohol content of the wine.

12- **`quality`** : This target column. Output variable (based on sensory data, score between 3 and 8).
